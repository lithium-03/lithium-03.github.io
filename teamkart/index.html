                    Formula Student (FS) is Europe's most established educational motorsport
                    competition, run by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Backed by the industry and high
                    profile engineers such as their Patron Ross Brawn OBE, the competition aims to inspire and
                    develop enterprising and innovative young engineers. Universities from across the globe are
                    challenged to design and build a single-seat racing car in order to compete in static and
                    dynamic events, which demonstrate their understanding and test the performance of the vehicle.

                    It seeks to challenge university students to conceive, design, build, cost, present and compete as a team with
                    a small single-seat racing car in a series of static and dynamic competitions. The format of
                    the event is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve
                    their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of
                    a motorsport competition.

                    Our first car, the KX-1, was completed in 18 months. We participated in Formula Student 2010 thus making us the only
                    team from Eastern India and amongst the few Indian teams to be a part of this prestigious event.
                    We stood 9th in the cost report analysis, making us one of the most cost-efficient teams
                    We were amongst the 6 shortlisted teams for the Airbus Team Work Award.

                    Having completed our second car, the K-1, in just 7 months, we participated in Formula Student 2011. This being the
                    first time we actually took the car to the event, we managed to outperform  the other rookie teams.
                    We are amongst the top 3 rookie teams at the event.

                    We started designing our our third car, the K-2, in the December of 2011. The manufacture of the car took us about 5
                    months and we began its testing in the June of 2012. Having finished and optimizing our vehicle we are
                    now waiting for the onset of FSAE-2013 with bated breath! We hope to not just match but to improve upon our previous performances at the event.

                    Formula SAE at IIT Kharagpur took a solid form in October 2008, when a
                    group of enthusiastic students got together to form TeamKART. It was started up as a project
                    under the aegis of the Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC) of IIT Kharagpur
                    and under the purview of the Mechanical Department. Since then there has been a steady rise in our
                    workforce and our potential as a team.

                    Our journey began with our first car, the KX-1. We faced many problems in our fledgling years, mainly due to a
                    lack of financial aid and technical knowledge. However with the help of some determination and
                    a lot of perseverance, we rose above all obstacles and managed to build our car. Our first
                    successful run gave a huge boost to our confidence and also served the purpose of showing the
                    Institute, our sponsors and our alumni, our ambition and determination to succeed. After that
                    we, in the span of less than 2 years, achieved the feat of competing in an international event
                    with our second car, the K-1.
